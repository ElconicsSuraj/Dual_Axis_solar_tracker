Textual Description of Connections:
LDR Connections:
Top Left LDR (ldrTopLeft - A1):

One leg of the LDR connects to Analog Pin A1 on the Arduino.
The other leg of the LDR connects to GND (Ground) on the Arduino.
Top Right LDR (ldrTopRight - A2):

One leg of the LDR connects to Analog Pin A2 on the Arduino.
The other leg of the LDR connects to GND on the Arduino.
Bottom Left LDR (ldrBottomLeft - A0):

One leg of the LDR connects to Analog Pin A0 on the Arduino.
The other leg of the LDR connects to GND on the Arduino.
Bottom Right LDR (ldrBottomRight - A3):

One leg of the LDR connects to Analog Pin A3 on the Arduino.
The other leg of the LDR connects to GND on the Arduino.
Servo Connections:
Horizontal Servo (servoHorizontal):

The signal wire (typically yellow or white) of the servo connects to Digital Pin 10 on the Arduino.
The power wire (typically red) of the servo connects to the 5V pin on the Arduino.
The ground wire (typically black or brown) of the servo connects to GND on the Arduino.
Vertical Servo (servoVertical):

The signal wire of the servo connects to Digital Pin 9 on the Arduino.
The power wire of the servo connects to the 5V pin on the Arduino.
The ground wire of the servo connects to GND on the Arduino.
